# Daily Log — 2026-02-19

**09:22** — I recently asked you to put a doc in obsidian about a repo with an extensive obsidian memory keeping system. do you see it?

**09:38** — No, let me find it again on the web: https://github.com/agenticnotetaking/arscontexta --- I asked you to evaluate this to see what I do and what I don't do, and you found a neat memory system. You also said you'd striopmine it for the good stuff if I cloned it. Going to do that now.

**09:40** — So, what's in the memory.md that's open?

**09:41** — nah, we're good. thx!

**09:41** — So, wha'ts in the memory.md that's open?

**09:46** — no, it's cool. thx. going to change gears in a min

**09:47** — LEt me question, is the full ralph queue orchestration overkill? On one hand, I'd love to do more, but on the other resources are a constraint.

**09:49** — Clarification question:   4. Session-capture upgrade — Stop hook writes current.json that the next session's orient hook reads directly.
  Previous→next session continuity without complex infrastructure. --- how is that different than what I do now? I should be writing to logs and loading up the last 20k worth of yesterdays and todays into the session

**09:53** — OK. And the data here can be saved to the obsidian vault, right?

**09:54** — No, please do implement Tier 1 patterns. When you are done, give me a bulleted point list of non-technical yet AI-focused points of what this is doing for us.

**10:00** — Let's do tier 2 as well

**10:04** — I'd like to re-work some of the sections of the newly remade Heroes button. The tabbed interface across the top has given some space issues for scrolling the roster, and made the party screen scroll (which sucks). For the heroes roster tab, jsut accounting for the extra space in the scroll so the interface doesn't require you to 'scroll twice' to reach the bottom For the party page, we need to talk about it

**10:06** — Is there something we should do to fill this sense of self or add to the reasoning behind practices?

**10:09** — I don't like the synergy bar. I REALLY don't like the labelling. Maybe we can keep the hero type count but more it somewhere else so it doesn't take up so much space? Compacting the hero slots so that the synergy bar can go vertical next to it might work

**10:11** — Yea, sounds good. If the why isn't obvious, let's talk about it a little.

**10:12** — The autofill can be smaller than Manage Heroes for sure. Other than the first time you make a team, you likely won't use it agian is my experience. but it's nice for newbies

**10:13** — Yes, those are good items. Don't think there are code changes involved with this, but if there are they need TDD

**10:20** — 4. Yes. Even still, specifically for Dorf, Claude will make up effect names, engine effects that won't work, and the like. Sometimes I think it gets these from planning or idea sessions, but it could all be solved by looking at the battle engine or the hero's skill config. 5. I think it comes from 2-ish things. 1: I work on multiple computers w/ Claude and I even share SOME memory between the two. Verifying that we are developing with the right tools in mind is good. 2: there was one time where we (and I do mean we) developed an entire feature on a verison of PHP that we wern't going to use in production, and we had to downgrade the codebase afterward. 6. I got the inspiration for the timing from OpenClaw, but I chose to look for it because I wanted to have 1: a way to preserve better context when a compact happened and 2: I am someitmes non-specific in my wording and that usually gets cleared up by knowing what I was working on last. To comment on 3. I feel like that was a counter-dir...

**10:26** — browser please. if you can just load some starter hero data for me, that's be awesome.

**10:27** — sorry, go ahead

**10:30** — enough got there for me to check with. love it. 1) keep in mind how to seed heroes for future testing sessions. 2) let's put this into main and ship it

**10:32** — Sweet! Excited to see how this all pans out! Can you please add git commit ~/.claude

**10:34** — Hey... when a subagent boots up, does it get all the memory from the log files? I'm assuming so.

**10:34** — OK, perfect.

**10:38** — tavern files, yea. logs need merged. The differences come from the computer I was working on... Actually, lets talk about that for a min. There a way to seperate 'logs' from this comptuer I'm using right now from the 2nd computer I use? I'd like to have both so I can say something like "Hey, I'm working on Dorf right now" or "we talked about this at work" and you'd know to look elsewhere. Also, I do meta-work like adding to configs and such in both places. Maybe 'project specific' logging is the answer. But even then, that doesn't fix the issue where I do these meta updates here then go home and do somethigjn different from the latest hawtness I just read about -0- how do you merge the logs. What are your thoughts.

**10:40** — I want to rework Expeditions a little. I'm open for some ideas, but one thing I want to do is allow a user to send off an expedition with less than 5 heroes. I'd have it bring back less resources. I also want to fix the interface such that the scrolling is less obnoxious - maybe have the whole hero picker be a seperate window/modal/page or something.  Not 100%.  Also, I know we talked to /dorf-critique a while ago about the page, but let's involve them again.

**10:41** — let's do hostnames

**10:41** — Shithead (which, for the record, is pronoucned like Shi-theed)

**10:44** — Hmmm... That was set up that way for reasons that probably don't serve us anymore. Can you re-configure t hiongs to match our intention now?
