# Daily Log — 2026-02-18

**08:11** — We just finished looking at what was different from the compiled app.js to the existing dashboard to find new features that were added. Do you remember?

**08:13** — No, I want to find out what we don't know. Let's plan a design document like we were about to implement things, but isntead of asking me the questions you have, let's write them down. I won't have the answers to your questions without asking for help anyway. So, can we do a soft-development plan?

**08:38** — See if the answers to the php questions are in the ~/pvcopy copy of the code, since the code in that directory is taken from the same source the app.js was.

**08:43** — Let's look at the questions that are open first.

**08:47** — So, I'm not 100% familiar with Log Viewer, but I know that the current expectation is that if an element on the dashboards links to another part of the application, it would go there in the program just the same as if the user found the item in the menu and clicked on it.

**08:50** — Again, not familiar w/ the log viewer specifically, however the PV app tries to act like a one-page app. the header stays constant, the menu will sometimes change with context (maybe - that was changed in the new pvcopy as well), but it's the content itself that changes mostly and the header stays the same.

**08:52** — Yes, lets look at the other open questions.

**08:59** — Q8: consume the generated bullpen.i18n.js  Q9: ran as part of builds. technically thats completely new development, but the intent is to have it ran during build time. Q10: I forget if that's the repo that has the real tooltip implemenation or not, but that is also new development that hasn't gone out the door. Because of many things outside of scope of discussion, I have a lot of development work that needs to get out the door, and tooltips is part of that. Q11: The tooltips need to be comprehensive, so when we start to combine things for a release I want to make sure we have everything labelled as best as possible.

**09:06** — Q12: so we don't need pull-all anymore. As a nice to have for the dashboard ,we need to revisit what feature that was trying to give (that I removed the ui for) and that's dashboard sharing. It use to be that someone would mark their dashboard as private (default) or public. If they chose public, their name and button to the dashboard would appear on the dashboard 'home screen' (don't think we even talked about that yet) and a user could click on it to make it part of their dashboards. It didn't direclty let them view the other's dashboards, it just made a copy and the pull-all was filtered into letting someone see what was available. Q13: not as relevant now, but most clients have a 'decent' number that has never been a problem -- but others have done things that did cause problems. Q14: yea, hide editing ui completely - no drag, no nothing

**09:07** — Yea, the home screen has options to load 2 different pre-build dashboards (a defense and a system), a custom dashboard -- which just makes a new empty dashboard for the user, and when sharing was a thing the sharing options. I'll get into the Qs now

**09:08** — Q18: It's a thing. It needs answered. Sorry I can't be more helpful. Q19: If we can do mock-based Playwright, that's great. We need to also have a live vm test as a form of integraiton test. Q20: strictly after parity, pls. Might be extra work, but I want ot keep focus.

**09:23** — Let's handle dashboard sharing last, since it does need a whole conversation. Let's do a real-boy design plan that we could make an implementation plan off of and see what shakes out.

**09:27** — B. well, we need to keep the cljs code active on the one other page that uses it (forget which one) but maybe as part of this refactor we tackle that too. Also, all the non-dashboard pages are PHP-rendered, with the exception of that one cljs page.

**09:29** — I think A sounds ok.

**09:31** — A sounds right for the time being.

**09:31** — A sounds good to me

**09:33** — sounds good... but do you have context for this performance data interface at all? like, what does it do?

**09:34** — ok, cool, thanks. This is good.

**09:40** — I like the inlining, too. Yes, this looks good.

**09:41** — I think this will work.

**09:47** — think this reads correctly.

**09:48** — I think it does.

**09:51** — I think that covers them, yes.

**10:01** — Yes

**10:04** — No, lets go ahead and implement it. Let's use /implementing-design-docs 

**10:11** — Use pvcopy as a reference, but this development needs to be done in my ~/code/github/bullpen-web director. We need to make sure the dashboard tech refresh branch has a clean commit so we have a cutoff point for this work, then we work off of that branch.

**10:17** — A is the winner I think.

## Summary

### Test file created: `/home/deltran/code/github/bullpen-web/.worktrees/dashboard-parity-impl/src/dashboard/e2e/version-info.spec.ts`

Four Playwright tests covering:
1. **"Show Releases" button exists** -- verifies the toggle button renders when version data is present in the API response
2. **Clicking "Show Releases" reveals 4 version rows** -- expands and checks all labels (System Release, UI Release, DB Release, List Release) and their values (3.2.1, 2.1.0, 1.5.0, 4.0.0)
3. **Clicking "Hide Releases" collapses the version rows** -- verifies the toggle works in both directions
4. **Toggle state persists after page reload** -- expands versions, reloads the page, confirms versions are still visible and the button reads "Hide ...

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Playwright Tests (test-first approach)

**File:** `/home/deltran/code/github/bullpen-web/.worktrees/dashboard-parity-impl/src/dashboard/e2e/current-traffic-filter.spec.ts`

Nine test cases covering:
- Widget has a settings gear icon (verifies `hasSettings: true` registration)
- Clicking settings opens drawer with all five filter sections (Result, CIDR, Protocol & Port, Country, Reason)
- Applying a BLOCK result filter causes the fetch URL to include `filter-result[]=BLOCK`
- "Filter Outdated" chip appears immediately after saving new filter settings
- "Filter Outdated" chip clears after the next auto-refresh cycle completes
- CIDR source/dest input fields are visible in the drawer
- Port input fields appear conditionally only when TCP or ...

## Changes Made

Created a new test file with 3 tests:

- **`renders SVG with country paths`** -- Verifies the World Map widget renders an SVG with country path elements after mocking both the `/home/countryTraffic.php` API and the CDN-hosted world-atlas TopoJSON.

- **`colorizes countries with traffic data (not default gray)`** -- Verifies that countries with traffic data (US and Ghana) get non-`#ddd` fill colors, while countries without traffic data (France) remain default gray.

### 1. `window.__PV_USER` injection in `/home/deltran/code/github/bullpen-web/.worktrees/dashboard-parity-impl/html/index.php` (lines 1454-1462)

Added a `<script>` block before the React bundle that reads `$_SESSION['grp']` and maps the numeric group value to a human-readable role string:

- `>= 630` -> `"consumer"`
- `>= 620` -> `"view-only"`
- `>= 610` -> `"manager"`
- `< 610` -> `"admin"` (default, also used when session is not set)

This matches the constants defined in `/home/deltran/code/github/bullpen-web/.worktrees/dashboard-parity-impl/html/util/user.php` (ADMIN=600, MANAGER=610, VIEW_ONLY=620, CONSUMER=630).

## Code Review: Context Group Editor Port (Design Doc Item 4)

### Summary

The Context Group Editor has been ported from ClojureScript/re-frame to React/TypeScript as a standalone component. The implementation is well-structured, covers the core functionality, and includes 12 Playwright tests. The code is clean, readable, and follows project conventions. There are a few issues worth addressing, ranging from a correctness bug in the hidden checkbox logic to minor style and coverage concerns.

---

### What Was Done Well

- **Clean architecture.** The decision to use local `useState` instead of Zustand is correct for a standalone component. The separation of `ContextGroupEditor` and `TransferPanel` into distinct components keeps things readable.
- **Type safety.** The `Cont...

## Implementation Summary

### 1. `src/utils/tooltips.ts` -- i18n lookup utility

**File:** `/home/deltran/code/github/bullpen-web/.worktrees/dashboard-parity-impl/src/dashboard/src/utils/tooltips.ts`

- Declares `window.bpi18n` as an optional `Record<string, string>` on the global `Window` interface
- `tooltipKeyToI18nKey(key)` -- converts dot-notation like `"dashboard_current_traffic.filter_result"` to `"TT_DASHBOARD_CURRENT_TRAFFIC_FILTER_RESULT"`, matching the pattern in `pvui.common.tooltip/tooltip-key->i18n-key`
- `getTooltipText(key)` -- performs the lookup on `window.bpi18n`, returns `string | null`

- Declares the `window.__PV_USER` global type
- Exports `isConsumer()` which checks `window.__PV_USER?.role === 'consumer'`

### Modified files

**`/home/deltran/code/github/bullpen-web/.worktrees/dashboard-parity-impl/src/dashboard/src/components/widgets/WidgetWrapper.tsx`**
- Imports `isConsumer` from `userContext`
- When `isConsumer()` is true: all toolbar buttons (settings, pause, drag handle, remove) are hidden, title is visible but not click-to-edit (cursor set to `default`, `onClick` removed), title editing is blocked even if `editing` state somehow gets set

## Code Review Report: Items 5, 6, and 7 - Dashboard Parity Implementation

### Executive Summary

I reviewed the implementation of Items 5 (Chart Drill-Down), 6 (Consumer User Lock-down), and 7 (Tooltip Integration) against the design document. The implementation is **mostly correct** but has **3 Critical issues** that must be fixed before shipping:

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

#### 1. **Drill-Down Missing in 3 of 5 Required Widgets**

**Severity:** Critical  
**Location:** `TopPortsWidget.tsx`, `ConnectionAttemptsWidget.tsx`, `TopBlockingMechanismWidget.tsx`

**Issue:** The design doc (Section 5, lines 205-213) specifies that 5 widgets should have chart drill-down functionality:
1. Traffic by Country ✓ (implemented)
2. Top Ports ✗ (missing)...

Read the output file to retrieve the result: /tmp/claude-1000/-home-deltran-code-github-bullpen-web/tasks/b6d30a0.output

**14:07** — hmmm. give me a link to both the design and the implementation doc?

**16:36** — Hmmm. Well, if we've addressed everything that the design doc says needs addressed.. I gues this is done for now.

**16:36** — ops, ai died. wanna try again?

**17:56** — We need to make a new branch for the work we're about to talk about. I want to change how hero duplicates work. Right now, you get extra copies of a hero, and they are full-fledged heroes. I want to instead make it such that when you get a 'copy' you get some sort of fusion essense that is specific to that hero instead. no more duplicate hero. You use the specific fussion essence to make merges. After you have everything you need out of copies -- you have a 5* and you don't need any of that specific hero for merging into 5* for attunement -- then copies of that hero make a generic poor/common/rare/epic/legendary essence that can be merged still and also used for the generic 5* requirement for attunement but also can be now spent in a new store that only accepts essence. Make a branch for this work, document what I want, and then get /dorf-ideation, /dorf-critique, and /dorf-cynic to weigh in on it. Save their thoughts down.

**17:59** — hey ,wait a minute... svae what you can. I want to update claude code so you get sonnet 4.6

**18:00** — thx! talk to you soon

<result>The critique has been written to `/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/docs/ideation/fusion-essence-critique-2026-02-18.md`.

Here is a summary of the evaluation:

**Strengths identified:**
- The system solves a genuine pain point with dead-weight 5-star dupes and collection clutter
- The two-tier essence model (hero-specific, then generic) creates a natural progression arc from personal investment to strategic flexibility
- The Essence Shop provides a necessary late-game sink

**Key risks flagged:**
- **Pull moment dopamine** -- Converting dupes to essence at pull time risks turning the gacha reveal into a flat "you got dust" notification, which is a major downgrade from the current full-hero-card experience
- **Essence inflation** -- Without defined conversion rates and shop prici...

<result>The cynic review has been written and saved to `/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/docs/ideation/fusion-essence-cynic-2026-02-18.md`.

Here is a summary of the key criticisms:

1. **Worst-case player reactions** -- Essence replaces the concrete "I got a hero" moment with an abstract number. The dopamine hit is strictly worse. The capstone sacrifice interaction (does essence replace a living sacrifice?) adds confusion.

2. **Migration pain** -- Players hoarding dupes for planned merges will feel robbed if auto-converted. The fix: never auto-convert, let players opt in, and show exact equivalencies.

3. **Economy traps** -- Two essence types (hero-specific + 5 tiers of generic) create fragile conversion math. The Essence Shop is either too powerful (making gems/gold redundant) or too w...

**18:09** — I liked the ideas you proposed -- I was thinking a straight-forward conversion, what you recommended, but I like what you said.  I wanted to know more.

**18:18** — so, only a hero that exists natively at 5* needs to use a dupe of themselves to get their attunement capstone. 4* need a generic 5* of any flavor, 3* need a 4*, on down. with that knowledge, how would we want to restructure this, if at all?

**18:18** — changing capstone costs is on the table, btw

**18:20** — i think that feels right

**18:24** —   I like this all Can you tell me what kind of art assets I'd ideally need for this? if any? or are we handling the mosaic programatically?

**18:26** — yea, lets move on

**18:33** — yea think that works. make sure the qty of echos is useful - no "oh, i hope I get this same purchase next week, othwerise it's a waste" kinda thing

**18:37** — yea, lets do it

**18:42** — want to throw out there, we have a loading bar on the splash screen now for combining the loot tables. we can do the processing there for conversion, and if things convert the notices can be the first thing we show the player when tap to move the splash screen. ALSO if we do something nicer than our notice pop-up, we can re-use tht pattern in the future if we ever do another conversion and need to explain to the player what happened. otherwise, I like it.

**18:48** — Actually, since this is a brand new branch, a worktree isn't required here. thx for asking.

- **`/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/src/utils/__tests__/migrateDuplicates.test.js`** -- 18 tests, all passing

### Implementation Summary

The `migrateDuplicates(heroesStore, inventoryStore)` function:

1. **Groups** `heroesStore.collection` by `templateId`

## Self-Review and Report: Task 8 -- GachaScreen Echo Dissolution Animation

### What Was Done

Task 8 adapted GachaScreen.vue and SummonRevealCard.vue to handle the new pull result shapes produced by the gacha store after Task 3 (echo/anima production for duplicates). The core problem was that duplicate pulls no longer carry an `instance` property, but GachaScreen referenced `result.instance.instanceId` in multiple places, causing crashes.

### Files Modified (6 files, +286 / -78 lines)

## Self-Review and Report: Task 8 -- GachaScreen Echo Dissolution Animation

### What Was Done

Task 8 adapted GachaScreen.vue and SummonRevealCard.vue to handle the new pull result shapes produced by the gacha store after Task 3 (echo/anima production for duplicates).

## Self-Review and Report: Task 8 -- GachaScreen Echo Dissolution Animation

### What Was Done

Task 8 adapted GachaScreen.vue and SummonRevealCard.vue to handle the new pull result shapes produced by the gacha store after Task 3 (echo/anima production for duplicates).

## Self-Review and Report: Task 8 -- GachaScreen Echo Dissolution Animation

### What Was Done

Task 8 adapted GachaScreen.vue and SummonRevealCard.vue to handle the new pull result shapes produced by the gacha store after Task 3 (echo/anima production for duplicates).

- **`/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/src/components/__tests__/SoulMirror.test.js`** -- Test suite (163 lines, 24 tests)

### What It Does

Grid cells start opaque (frosted dark) and progressively become transparent to reveal the portrait underneath, based on `currentEchoes / totalEchoesNeeded`. The reveal follows a spiral pattern from the center outward (Ch...

**21:01** — yes, please implement the rest

**21:02** — so, I use to have a StartSession in settings.json that would run load-history.sh.  Apparently something happened within the past 24hrs that caused this to balloon and it would fill up your context window immediately upon starting a session. Can you look at what happened and come up with 2 or 3 ways to mitigate or prevent that from happening again while preserving the memory system I tried to make?

**21:20** — Yea, option 3 sounds good. please set this up. ensure this is something that I can commit usig my .claude repo

**21:21** — pull main, ebase to it, then make a clean commit

**21:22** — Can you re-hook up the settings.json with it's SessionStart hook it should have?

**21:25** — we need to make the limit about half again. 

**21:26** — shave another 5k from both please

**21:30** — push it

**21:33** — there is a ~/code/github/claude-code-memory-guide project w/ repo. Can you update it with the new update we just did, adding NON-PERSONAL information as context to the guide?

**21:37** — commit this

**21:37** — Oh, let's just merge it with main here and push it

**21:38** — yep
