# Daily Log — 2026-02-17

**09:13** — Can we make the claude-tavern command shut down and re-open the servers instead of just checking if they are running?

**09:20** — ~/obsidian/pwaddingham/Claude Sessions/session-2026-02-17-174500-react-dashboard-layout-fixes.md

**09:21** — Yea, make sure we are where we expect to be.

**09:37** — Well, I slightly forget what I was suppose to check for, but I do remember looking at the gap at the bottom and it looks good to me. I think we need to work on more visual pairity as a baseline before we start to improve anything.

**09:40** — So, I have the playwright plugin installed. How do I finish setting it up?

**09:40** — YOu're fantastic. /commit

**09:41** — I want to go one at a time and have you ask me to verify each one. 

**09:43** — LEt's enable it globally. I dont' see me not wanting this everywhere.

**09:47** — I found a neat site, https://lexler.github.io/augmented-coding-patterns/pattern-catalog/, but I'm feeling overwhelmed. Can you help me comb through this site and help extract some useful new features/patterns/ideas from it? I'm hoping there will be a lot, but i"m not certian.

## Augmented Coding Pattern Summaries

### 1. **Active Partner**
- **Problem:** AI defaults to silent compliance, following instructions without questioning unclear or problematic directives.
- **Solution:** Transform interaction into two-way dialogue by granting explicit permission for AI to challenge, question, and provide honest feedback. Use ground rules, conversational reinforcement, and visual markers.
- **Key Insight:** Giving AI permission to push back on unclear instructions prevents silent misalignment and creates genuine collaboration.

### 2. **Approved Fixtures**
- **Problem:** AI-generated tests are created rapidly but become impractical to review, especially with complex assertions.
- **Solution:** Design tests using approval files that pair ...

<result>Perfect! I successfully fetched all 15 patterns. Here's a concise summary of each:

## Augmented Coding Pattern Summaries

### 1. Feedback Flip
- **Problem:** AI prioritizes task completion over quality concerns like code standards
- **Solution:** After implementation, use a second AI pass focused solely on finding problems and suggesting improvements
- **Key Insight:** Shifting AI's focus from "complete the feature" to "ensure quality" reveals issues it previously overlooked

### 2. Feedback Loop
- **Problem:** AI requires constant human validation, creating bottlenecks
- **Solution:** Establish automated feedback mechanisms (tests, logs, CI) and give AI explicit permission to iterate autonomously until success criteria are met
- **Key Insight:** Human elevates from tactical executor to strategic director

### 3. Focused Agent

## Augmented Coding Patterns Summary

### 1. Parallel Implementations
- **Problem:** Non-deterministic AI makes first-attempt success unreliable, requiring sequential debugging.
- **Solution:** Run multiple implementations simultaneously from same checkpoint using git worktrees; review all results and select best or combine strengths.
- **Key Insight:** Trade cheap computational tokens for expensive developer time—run 3-5 parallel attempts for failure mitigation or explore solution space for quality.

### 2. Playgrounds
- **Problem:** Need safe experimental space for AI to test assumptions without risking production code or accumulating throwaway work.
- **Solution:** Create isolated, gitignored playground folder where AI ...

**09:57** — Sounds good :D

**09:58** — change looks ok to me. 

**10:08** — I have 2 bugs I've gotten. The smaller scope one (I think) is: every time I complete a quest/fight it seems to be defaulting to the highest level completed. So if I finish a quest on normal, it automatically drops into the hard quest region zone

**10:10** — One thing I've noticed is that our font changes adjust the font sizes of the entire app. We need to section off the greater application from the dashboard. When we talk about changing styles in the dashboard, they need to stay there and not bleed out into the header, footer, menu, etc.

**10:29** — Well, let's talk about another UI/flow bug first. The victory screen pop-up has a gigantic blank space on mobile. Think the shard section is what's doing it. C:\Users\deltr\Downloads\Screenshot_2026-02-17-10-26-50-41_143542433d1b819949b19621c899d3b7.jpg

**10:30** — Last UI level fix/change -- After the last set of development, Stack-style buffs get a 999 turn counter. Instead of a right-aligned 999 turn counter, they need to get a left-aligned stack count. PUt it in the gold color we use for things like leader skills to differentiate it.

**10:35** — jLEt me get you a picture for proof. Going to show you a combat with Mara Thornheart in it.  One of the images is in the combat scene, and you can clearly see 999 on her heartbreak stack buff. The other is the detail view that shows x2, which is cool - but my problem is showing the 999 on the battle. I'd like to replace that with a yellow/golden number indicating the number of stacks. I said left-aligned for that, but let's leave it right-aligned.

**10:37** — This looks good to me. What's next?

**10:40** — So, we just finish setting up playwright. How do we use that? More specifically, I want you to be able to visually identify the changes you make.

**10:47** — OK, my  bitwarden shit is getting in the way... Lets switch gears to fix that because you saw it breaking here. 

**10:48** — dumb question, I'm hopping around a lot... what changed?

**10:51** — Hmmm, ok. Yea, I see it. I don't like it, but let's keep it for now. I'm going to run critique on it all after a bit anyway. Waht's next?

**10:59** — OK. We need to investigate an issue brought to my attention. The original design intention was to allow players to unlock the blacksmith in an early region in Aquaria, then weapon items would start to drop in Aquaria (and beyond; not Western Veros normal). That's not happening. 

**10:59** — Sorry, had a thougjht, I'll save it for later.

**11:06** — Emoji status to skills???

**11:06** — OK, let's keep going

**11:06** —  no, let's keep looking at the blacksmith stuff. Just to earmark the thought, maybe it's time to re-think item drops.

**11:08** — are things working now? sorry, got distracted

**11:16** — Can we please continue to work on setting up playwright?

**11:18** — Hmmm.. what I've been seeing is the opposite of what you describe. I never see item drops, but I can unlock the blacksmith by completing prison_05.

**11:19** — JI've been seeing instances of you getting information wrong. There are multiple reasons for this, but one that just came to light is the research agent may have screwed up: ● Let me look at this more carefully — the research agent may have gotten it wrong.

● Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

● OK so the unlock IS wired up at quests.js:265 — clearing prison_05 unlocks the blacksmith. Now let me check what's happening
   with equipment drops. The user says they never see them.

**11:21** — Well, let me first paste in a little more of that conversation, then ask a question: ● Let me look at this more carefully — the research agent may have gotten it wrong.

● Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

● OK so the unlock IS wired up at quests.js:265 — clearing prison_05 unlocks the blacksmith. Now let me check what's happening
   with equipment drops. The user says they never see them.

● Searched for 2 patterns (ctrl+o to expand)

● So equipment IS listed in itemDrops for Aquaria quest nodes (outer_currents, drowned_prison). Let me check how item drops
  are processed — is there a gate that checks blacksmithUnlocked?

● Searched for 1 pattern, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● I see the issue — rollItemDrops at line 170 checks drop.chance but the equipment drops use chance: 0.04 (4%). However, look
  at line 171: const count = Math.floor(Math.random() * (drop.max - drop.min + 1)) + drop.min. It references drop.max and
  drop.min. Let me check if the ...

**11:21** — Should the researcher be using a better model?

**11:22** — and to be clear, the primary indicator that the research agent screwed up somehow was I reported a bug (not seeing blacksmith item drops), and the research agents said "oh, blacksmith is never unlocked" and I replied with "um, I can do it by going to this quest node" and mainline claude was like "yep, sure can"

**11:25** — I think both approaches are a good idea. I need to get more explicit with you. Opus has spoiled me by letting me be vague and you (usually correctly) figuring it out. But when I'm debugging something, I need real umph as well, not just better prompts.

**11:27** — Thank you for the updates!

**11:28** — Well, first, since this is fixed and item drops do happen to a good degree, let's /commit 

**11:29** — I should watch what's happening more often :( What would it take to implement this?

**11:31** — I think this particular session is done. Talk to you elsewhere!

**11:32** — Let's talk about item drops in a larger scale. I do have some specific quest node level drops, but A LOT of my item drops are universal. I don't know what the right level of control or override is, but I think it might be time to revisit how drops work.

**11:34** — Let's do part 1 now. We can do the tavern integration later. Might even throw that to a differnt session "right away"

**11:35** — Yea, I want you to do a test run against the vm again to make sure you can visually verify on your own.

**11:37** — That's great! But, there is another problem, and I think I just want to taclke this the easiest way possible. So, I have an odd system sync to get the code up to my vm. I run an rsync command here, which requires a pwd, then I need an rsync command sent to the server, whioch requires the same pwd, and then the code is in place. I want you to be able to do that, but I have bitwarden cli and the password prompt in the way. HOw can I enable you to bypass these restrictions?

**11:40** — I have an ssh config entry for the vm, pv240, so I'd just ssh-copy-id admin@pv240 ???

**11:41** — Eh, it's OK for skills that arn't mine to loose the icon I guess. Would be nice for it to stay, but I'm not sure there is anything that can be done about that w/ what we have.

**11:44** — OK, teach me to linux. I see this:  ✘ deltran@PVDeveloper  ~  ssh-copy-id root@pv240

**11:50** — Yea, A is what I want out of a system. IF there is something we can do to make sure the opperations are cheap, lets go that route tho

**11:51** — Can we  do this when the game first loads up? Maybe have a 'loading bar' on the splash screen while it's processing?

**11:53** — OK, I added the key to the user remote

**11:54** — That change looks fine. AFter these ui updates, next thing I want to ask about is the traffic by county load time. Maybe we need to steal a design from the old dashboard.

**11:55** — Yep, all ready did that! we're in business

**11:55** — So, in my zshrc I have a 'command' called pvsync. I think it'd be best for you to read that and see what we can do from there.

**11:56** — no, it needs a pwd... This is a vm, maybe we just enable root to be ssh'd into?

**11:58** — dun

**11:58** — Let's update pvsync for the new workflow.

**12:00** — didn't like --delete:  deltran@PVDeveloper  ~pv  ↱ unified-testing-and-tooltips  pvsync -t dashboard-tech-refresh -v

 deltran@PVDeveloper  ~pv  ↱ unified-testing-and-tooltips 

**12:01** — yea, I think that's fine. If we need real timing on things, we'll figure that out later.

**12:01** — we're alive!

**12:02** — wow, last sync made the widgets fat...

**12:04** — We unlock attunement runes and shards at different points in the game. It can accomodate that, too, correct?

**12:05** — shoulda read that example harder... sorry.

**12:05** — Yes it does!

**12:06** — Now, we can step through them. Might do it before we release next anyway, but this way we have somethign in place. Small slivers of value, right?

**12:07** — OK, great! So, I should be able to re-start my dashboard widget fixes session and ask it to verify what it's doing, correct?

**12:08** — add to the dev notes to update the admin interface to allow editing drops according to this new setup. Then let's use /implementing-design-docs 

**12:09** — if I quit now and re-start this, will you remember where we left off? need to give you new capabilities

**12:10** — there should be a dorf dev notes in obsidian somewhere. Otherwise, please continue

**12:11** —   ~/obsidian/pwaddingham/Claude Sessions/bullpen-web/session-2026-02-17-181500-react-dashboard-visual-parity.md --- and you should have access to playwright AND a non-password-prompting pvsync:   1. Make code changes in the bullpen-web worktree
  2. Run pvsync -t dashboard-tech-refresh to push to the VM
  3. Use Playwright to navigate to https://10.109.93.240:47881 and screenshot to verify

**12:11** — Thank you! **high five

**12:12** — Yea, there were things I wanted to talk about, but I've been doing so much stuff I forget what I was going to say next..

**12:14** — I want to talk about approved logs in some detail, but let me verify that Knowledge Checkpoint, Happy to Delete, and Canary in the Code Mine are more disciplines I adopt vs. things I make you do automatically, corret? Or am I missing something?

**12:16** — I have more questions. re: Happy to Delete --- I know working on bad code is a waste of time, but there are times where I expect processes to happen when I'm not at the keyboard. Would that claude.md note ruin automation? It seems like it.

**12:18** — Are you saying I don't pay attention?!?!?!?! How DARE you! ... kidding, you're right. Option 2 looks good. If I am paying attention, I don't mind stopping things and talking, and if I'm not here then you arn't just trying the wrong thing but harder.

**12:27** — Yea, let's talk about that one. I think we need more setup for that to be a thing? For one thing, I can't point to any Dorf logs. And for work, all I have are vanilla php logs with syntax errors. So... I'm lost about what I need for this pattern.

**12:29** — Maybe we adjusted thigns wrong -- I don't know how you misunderstood me using the very technical term 'fat' but here we are. So the height of the widgets seems very high, but the withd of them now feels thin. I don't mind adopting a higher resolution of widget placement and resizing, but I don't want to be obnoxious about it. Given what I see, what I originally meant, and my vauge direction of 'high resolution but not obnoxious' do you have any thoughts?

**12:31** — Yea, add that to the dorf backlog. I think that would be fantastic. Not the priority, but not only do I want to try the pattern out but sometimes combat bugs are just hard to 'prove'.

**12:32** — 1. Worktree as well.

**12:33** — Hey -- I'm assuming it's a superpower thing, but when I ask you to use superpowers to help make a whole feature, eventually you prompt me with something like the following:   Two execution options:

  1. Subagent-Driven (this session) — I dispatch fresh subagents per task, review between tasks, fast iteration. Tasks 1-3 run
   in parallel.

  2. Parallel Session (separate) — Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints.

  Which approach?

✻ Sautéed for 4m 33s

**12:35** — I always prefer subagent-driven. I sometimes like to clear context first, but I'm assuming you can't do that automatically for me w/o being in plan mode first? The other thing I frequently require is that the work be in a worktree. If I have a plan, I want a worktree 95% of the time.

**12:38** — OK, that sounds good to me. Thank you!

**12:39** — Hey... is your memolry file getting 'full'? I feel like we add a lot to it but I know it's limited..

**12:40** — ok, cool. If it's working then no need to muck with it. Thx for checking!

**12:42** — Hmmm... LEt's go with C for now. Keep option B in yoru back pocket in case I get a 'feel' that I don't like the standard option.

**12:43** — This thread is about the patterns. What is feedback flip? Is it different from when I ask to have another process spin up and find problems?

**12:45** — Let's re-evaluate implementing-design-docs with the intent of adding this as a feature to it. If we can remove something that's extra or reword the existing skill, that would be a good change.

**12:51** — We have the discord morning briefing that runs at home (theoretically), but I'd like to make a work-specific briefing prompt. I always come into work with 3-ish claude session terminals open and I forget what they are doing. I also tend to forget things told to me to do or look forward to, so we need to find a way to capture them and resurface that to me. Anything seem like a good fit for that? The more automated the better, but if I need to do something different (like actually record something) that's fine too.

**12:56** — I like that idea. IF it can do double-duty in that one phase and we also change 'who' is reviewing the code earlier, that works for me. I'm just paranoid about features loosing alignment and becoming spagetti'd mess. This approach soudns good to me.

**13:27** — IJ like it. Let's move on. What's left anyway?

**13:28** — please /commit ~/.claude/

**13:30** — Yes,j lets do that. Probablyh should have done that first. mAeh.

**13:33** — I really like the /remind --- I think the startup hook is a good idea. Want to mention, I havn't synced with the .claude repo recently, but we did take saving hooks out of that -- it caused problems with claude-tavern. But, I also don't want my home computer doing this, just this machine, so that works out.

**13:34** — So... do we still have our settings.json???

**13:34** — Ok, cool. Good. :D forgot about that

**13:36** — I feel like it takes longer to load than it did under the clojurescript implemantation. There is a neat thing that the old dashboard did, though, which is when it loads cover it with a "packetviper gray" div with a "packetviper red" spinner until it loaded. So that might have tricked me enough.

**13:36** — neat! thx!

**13:37** — Yea, not certian if I care or not... we can fix that later.

**13:38** — I'm OK for now. Still have to integrate the new habits. I'll probably ask about this again in a few days.

**13:42** — Can we pull up the list of todos that are in the dorf dev notes?

**13:44** — No, let's work on the inventory screen filter, pls. /brainstorming 

**13:56** — firstly, pull the master and resolve any confllso, I was under the impression this directory was clean...

**14:02** — what changed in routes/web.php?

**14:02** — Oh, ok, cool. Anyway, new work.  Based on research, help me brainstorm the best angle to take for a company-specific time-off manager. You should generate a few competing hypotheses, and recommend features for each.

A time-off manager should consist of the following elements:

Ability to allow an employee to put in a request ahead of time (up to 1/2 day increments)
Ability to allow an employee to put in a request back-dated
Ability to have the employee's manager approve or reject the request
Give visibility to HR to see all requests made and all requests approved
Record keep between different types of paid time off (PTO and Sick Days to start)
Dashboard for employees to see how much PTO and Sick time they have

**14:11** — Ok, great! /commit

**14:12** — hmmm... demo50 is public. maybe they closed this on purpose.

**14:13** — I wanted you to look at the code that is on there because it has GREATLY diverged from what I have access to... So I will likely just scp the code down to my local for you to look at.

**14:19** — Hey, I have to be root to get to the code on the box. How do I scp from that box to me here?

**14:21** — A does look good to me

**14:27** — looks good. Should mention that managers should get an email and link when a new request is made under them.

**14:29** — I have a feeling that sick time doesn't require manager approval. Makes some sense. Can we toggle whether a time off type requires manager approval?

**14:30** — this all looks good now

**14:30** — think this is good!

**14:30** — 1

**14:34** — yep, push it

**14:36** — Fantastic. Thank you!

**14:37** — OK, thanks! Going to clear this session out then have more work concerning this. we need tokens.....

**14:39** — hwo do you determien what tenure teir someone belongs in?

**14:41** — Allow this to be configurable, but a person's pto clears out based on the calendar year. Allow HR to see the remaining balance, but starting January 1st, employees get new allotments. Also, allow for holidays to appear on teh calendar.

**14:43** —  ~/obsidian/pwaddingham/Claude Sessions/bullpen-web/session-2026-02-17-190500-dashboard-visual-parity.md --- So we got a fun problem. There is a copy of the dashboard that I have the code for that isn't in the repo. It has dashboard updates that we need to figure out. Step one is to catalog all of the functionality changes. The "new" code is in ~/pvcopy/pvcopy. It' sstill written in clojurescript.

**14:44** — this looks like a good update

**14:48** — Please read the drop table info from obsidian. I want to get started on re-making the drop table data.

**14:50** — I think we should just plan what goes into each one, then come up with a plan to just swap new data into place. I'm not making new items atm.

**14:53** — does the drop table setup manipulate shard drop? Or is that excluded? 

**14:56** — OK, that's fine. Just didn't know if I needed to think about it. So, I have a way to 'calculate' the answer to how xp items get handed out. First, I want to know for all tomes what character level does the xp item provide 1% or less of a level, and what character level does each xp item provide 25% XP for the level. Can you make that table?

**14:58** — OK. So 1 thing. We've been working in a dashboard tech refresh directory. That should have feature pairity with the old clojsurescript dashboard. But it's built in react. Find that, please, then come back for more directions.

**15:01** — I'm getting a new copy of the code on the server right now. Gettiung more files. With that, you shosuld see that it is using clojurescript still. That's the dashboard I want you to compare against what we have. Compare it to the react, compare it to the non-dashboard-tech-refresh version of PV, either or both. We need a definitive list, with no error, of what has changed. I'll let you know when ~/pvcopy is ready again

**15:02** — Let's project a little. PRetend that we have a 4 and 5* rarity tome. They grant 5000 and 50000 respectively. What level whould they match to at teh 25% paradigm

**15:04** — oh, wow, good to know. Anyway, now withi this table, what I want to do is run our combat simulator per region and see what level 3* party can clear the region. I want you to put the name of the first regionid that has a level that passes the 25% at level value in a new column in the table

**15:09** — OK, this works out! What I want to do is introduce new higher tier tomes starting when they hit the 25% of a level mark (exception for faded tome, it's the first one and just exists at first). Have the tome quantity range grow such that it is always a minimum of 1, but only extend the max drop to allow that item to potentially cover 12%. When the item provides only 1% of what's needed, we drop it from the tables for that region. Does this make sense?

**15:12** — That's perfect! Before we move on, would a hypothetical 4* tome that grants 2,000 fit into our current level budget? Look at hardmode, too, pls

**15:14** — OK. Let's make a 4* 2,000xp item with this then, and add it to the scaling we're talking about. Your previous table seems to show exactly what I was expecting (prior to my addition of the 4* anyway)

**15:17** — Only other thing I have an approach for is the Record items. I want to allow them to drop 1) only if GLs are unlocked, 2) have 1* start dropping in The Summit, 3) calculate what level 3* could reasonabily win the highest tier for the Record's range, subtract 5 from it, and match it to the region level that way. -- after we figure that out, we cna talk drops.

**15:19** — Just to clarify a point: GLs ahve levels themselves, but they are brokein into 5-level spans via the records. So we would want to know when a hero party can be 'expected' to beat lvl6 to start dropping 2* records. (and just evaluate Valinar)

**15:21** — Hmmm... Let's ignore the -5 then... that still puts them equal tho right?

**15:23** — Yea, might be the plan... I want these to have a higher drop chance than keys, and once you get to 3*, we should drop 1* compoletely. Same for 2/4*

**15:47** — 25% sounds right. let's keep it simple

**15:48** — I want shard_dragon_heart to drop from every region starting with echoing caverns. I want the heart to start to drop from every region starting with the summit. 

**15:58** — They don't unlock with shards, they unlock with fusion, which should be a starter thing.

**15:59** — Can yo uverify that fusion is just unlocked from the get-go? It should be. I need it to not be locked.

**16:00** — 2% for the heart

**16:02** — I don't think i want gacha tickets to drop from random loot. Tokens for a region should start to drop in the next region. Equipment and materials need to start dropping in Aquaria ONLY when blacksmith is unlocked. I have no idea how I want junk items scaled.... attunement runes need to start to drop after the region that unlocks attunement.

**16:03** — Yea that sounds fine to me. We'll maybe add more later, but for now this works

**16:03** — Yea, sounds good to me!

**16:04** — where do keys drop for GLs?

**16:07** — Hmmm. So, the nodes leading into their fight need a 20% drop rate (with the 100% drop chance that is coded into the system on first defeat), but once that particular GL is discovered, keys for them need to drop in future areas.

**16:10** — Nope, keep dropping forever - but would be nice to say only 1 key drop per run. Can't get all 4 GL keys in one fight.

**16:11** — OK. Look in ~/pvcopy now. See if you can find an app.js -- I forgot we only have access to the compiled dashboard from this code......

**16:12** — I think that'll be fine. this lets us group some things, and that's enough i think.

**16:17** — Yes, please. As a matter of fact, /implementing-design-docs 

**16:22** — ok, ~/app.js

**16:25** — 1) yea, 90% for primary, 100% for old if it's still around.

**16:28** — 3) GL keys chance needs to start once you reach the mountains, under the condition you have unlocked at least 1 GL. Valinar's key needs to also drop in the first few nodes infront of him, to try to give the playe rmore keys for the first run. Same with all other GLs, the nodes leading up to them give a dedicated key drop chance. Also, as per the hardcoded result, the node direclty infront of a GL should have a one-time garunteed drop of the key (on first beating it) 2) A is fine, we can compute it now and just do it. 4) Yea, Janxier Floodplain. Don't know if that info is helpful anymore given what I said for #3

**16:31** — Need to review the doc... I need to come up with a plan to present to my boss that talks about how to incorporate all these updates into our existing system. I'd also like to make this the introduction of the react dashboard, after some polish and a face lift.

**16:45** — I do like approachA

**16:52** — Just to set things straight, I was asked to come up with a plan for feature pairity between the app.js and our 'working' dashboard. I want to do the switch with the new dashboard tech at the same time. I also want to mention that now is the time to update the style using industry leaders as guidance (as pointed to by Frank Trama).

**16:53** — Frank Trama is the CEO. I'm sending this to my direct boss, the CTO

**16:54** — Ok, good.

**16:56** — eh, leave it at 10% per key...actually, I'm worried that that'll make some keys easier to come by than others. Can we have it just be a flat 10% for a key to drop,and we roll within that when we hit it?

**16:57** — First-clear guaranteed key drops on the node directly before each GL <--- this is an existing feature. If we want to move it to the drop tables, that's fine, but we do this today.

<summary>Agent "Fix fiscal year scoping" completed</summary>
<result>Here is a summary of what was done.

## Summary

### Problem
The `fiscal_year_start` setting (MM-DD format) was configurable in the admin settings UI, but all code that needed the fiscal year simply used `now()->year` or `Carbon::parse($date)->year`, ignoring the configured start date entirely.

### Solution

**New helper methods on `TimeoffSetting`** (`/home/deltran/code/github/backoffice/.worktrees/feat-timeoff-manager/apps/timeoff/app/Models/TimeoffSetting.php`):

- `fiscalYearFor(Carbon $date): int` -- Reads the `fiscal_year_start` setting and determines the correct fiscal year for any given date. The fiscal year number is the calendar year in which the fiscal year began. For example, with a July 1 start, a date of 2026-05-15 returns fiscal year 2025, while 2026-08-15 returns 2026.

- `currentFiscalYear(): int` -- Convenience wrapper that ca...

**17:05** — This is going to be done "in one shot" -- we can say we have checkpoints for expected progress. The ordering is fine by me tho.

I agree with you on the core point: perception matters more than we like to admit, especially for a platform that’s meant to convey stability, control, and trust.

When I think about how PacketViper should feel visually, a few principles come to mind rather than specific UI treatments:

Calm and controlled, not loud or flashy
Intentional, where nothing feels arbitrary or decorative
Operational, like a system designed for people who rely on it under pressure
Modern but restrained, avoiding trends that age quickly
I’m less concerned with a single facelift and more aligned with the idea of incremental, verified improvements that establish a visual standard we can apply consistently across the platform.

For reference, a few products that give me a sense of stability and reliability (not necessarily stylistically identical, but directionally sound):
