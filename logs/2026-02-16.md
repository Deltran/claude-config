**01:02** — UI facing thing. The effect details when in combat show the json data. No 'normal' player is going to understand that. Can we convert those to a more human readable description?

**01:10** — Sweet!

**01:38** — merge with main

**01:41** — Hey, I gave you a full sized fellowship_hall_bg.png -- can you adjust the display to work with that?

**01:55** — Can you make the banner for the newest hero set?

**01:58** — add to the dorf dev notes that we need to have a filter on the inventory screen.

**02:00** — evening tavern bg is taken care of.

**08:49** — Hey, I didn't get my morning briefing :sad_tear_emoji:

**05:37** — IJ think so! Please use /implementing-design-docs for finishing the plan and implementation. Please orchastrate the rest yourself. I hav eno desire to give more feedback on this, since I am still aggitated. 

**05:38** — Wow, that's awesome! Thank you!

**05:40** — Can you merge main together with what's in the other branch feat/thaw-rite-banner please? Push it when you're done.

**...

**09:10** — The  claudebot gave me the following message, which I did verify was true per request. I keep hitting permission blocks on shell commands. Can you approve one of these so I can check on your crontab? In the meantime:

Why the morning briefing didn't fire: Most likely claude-cron sync was never run (or was run but the crontab didn't persist across a WSL restart). The job is registered in jobs.json as enabled, but it needs to be synced to the actual crontab. Run:

claude-cron sync


Then verify with:

crontab -l


You should see the # BEGIN claude-jobs / # END claude-jobs block with the 0 7 * * * entry. If WSL restarts cleared the crontab, you'll need to re-sync after each restart (or we can add it to your .zshrc or a WSL startup script).

Want me to keep trying to fix this, or did the briefing above cover what you needed?

**09:11** — that's what I thought, but wanted to verify :D

**09:12** — Are there any other things we can do to harden the process? I wouldn't mind establishing a pattern now so when I ask for The Hawt New Feature Everyone Is Reading About it won't kill the process.

**09:16** — Can we come up with a personal solution to all of my private key info being put into files? My .zshrc has some, the discord bot one got leaked -- I need something

**09:24** — A sounds good -- but one problem I've run into is that every time I try to get something from the bitwarden cli, it asks me to log in. Annoying for getting the remote pwd for the 7th time, but would kill automation.

**09:27** — I'm OK with the cache layer. There a way to have each new terminal session auto-ask for the pwd, and if I screw it up (or it's not me) then that's fine? Or would existing sessions see teh .secrets-cache?

**09:35** — Hmmmm... I'm thinking non-blocking? I don't want some other automated process to get tripped up on this feature.

**09:35** — yes

**09:46** — So, for the specs I produce, for the bugs that have occured, for my workflow I tend to do -- is sonnet OK to use? I'm nervous, Opus is awesome, but sometimes I just feel like I can't keep going when I want to.

**09:51** — OK. I'll give it a try starting today. How do we switch over to using sonnet for coding? Do we just make sure we always spin up an agent for spec-based coding and tdd? (that use sonnet of course)

**09:52** — I don't mind using Opus for the 'main chat'. I feel better with that, even when I'm telling you no-op things like a long-winded "no, don't switch now"

**09:53** — If you are going to remember that, then perfect! Thanks!

**10:07** — Ok, sounds great! Thank!

**10:18** — This is great. Thanks!

**10:18** — I think so -- honestly trusting you on this call.

**10:20** — First, did we remove Record items from the gold shop? I don't see them anymore.

**10:24** — OH. Yea. that's right. Thanks!

**10:25** — I can't seem to find the file we use as the splash-screen background. What file is that?

**10:25** — that makes symantic sense. Thx!

**10:38** — Yes I am

**10:43** — that looks cool to me

<result>## Research Complete

I've thoroughly investigated the enemy tap highlight feature and documented my findings in `/home/deltran/code/dorf/thoughts/research/2026-02-16-enemy-tap-highlight-feature.md`.

### Key Findings:

**The enemy tap highlight feature no longer exists.** It was removed on 2026-02-15 as part of a UI polish pass.

**Original Implementation (removed):**
- **File**: `/home/deltran/code/dorf/src/screens/BattleScreen.vue`
- **Feature**: `.enemy-name-tooltip` — a hover-triggered tooltip that appeared above enemies showing their name
- **Added**: Commit `8f8cc96` (2026-01-24)
- **Removed**: Commit `e742bc7` (2026-02-15) with explicit message "Remove enemy name tooltip on tap/hover in battle"

**Current Enemy Interaction:**
1. **Short tap/click** → `selectEnemyTarget(enemy)` at line ~1309 — selects enemy as combat target
2. ...

## Research Complete

I've written a full research document to `/home/deltran/code/dorf/thoughts/research/2026-02-16-miniboss-music-trigger.md`.

### Key Findings

**1. How `isSoloEnemy` is computed:**
- **BattleScreen.vue:1578**: `const isSoloEnemy = computed(() => battleStore.enemies.length === 1)`
- Simple numeric check with no awareness of enemy identity or role

**2. Battle music selection:**
- **App.vue:468-484**: Initial battle start music selection
- **BattleScreen.vue:1023-1032**: Between-wave music switch
- **bgmContextMap.js:123-135**: `getBattleTrack()` uses `isSoloEnemy` to choose between `'battle_miniboss'` and `'battle'` base tracks

**3. Hard mode overrides:**
- **hardMode/index.js:25-44**: `getHardModeNode()` merges base node with overrides

### Key Findings:

**1. "Exploration" Button Text Issue**
- **File**: `/home/deltran/code/dorf/src/screens/WorldMapScreen.vue`
- **Template**: Lines 853-862
- **CSS**: Lines 1929-1966 (base button), 2247-2254 (exploration variant)
- **Problem**: Button uses `font-size: 1.1rem` with text "Start Exploration" (16 characters), plus a 1.2rem emoji icon and 16px padding each side. The exploration variant only changes colors, not text sizing.

**2. "Markets" Title Issue**
- **File**: `/home/deltran/code/dorf/src/screens/GoodsAndMarketsScreen.vue`

<summary>Agent "Fix Exploration button text" completed</summary>
<result>Perfect! I've fixed the issue by:

1. **Reduced font size**: Changed from the inherited `1.1rem` to `0.95rem` specifically for the exploration button
2. **Added text overflow safety**: Added `white-space: nowrap`, `overflow: hidden`, and `text-overflow: ellipsis` to prevent text from wrapping or overflowing the button

The fix is minimal and surgical - it only affects the exploration button variant (`.start-quest-btn.exploration-btn`) without touching the base button styles or any other variants.

## Summary

**File modified**: `/home/deltran/code/dorf/src/screens/WorldMapScreen.vue`

**Changes**:
- Reduced exploration button font size from `1.1rem` (inherited) to `0.95rem`
- Added overflow protection with `white-space: nowrap`, `overflow: hidden`, and `text-overflow: ellipsis`

This ensures "Start Exploration" (and the other button states: ...

## Changes Made to `/home/deltran/code/dorf/src/screens/GoodsAndMarketsScreen.vue`

### Layout Constraints Added:

1. **Back button** (line 201): Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent it from ever shrinking
2. **Title block** (lines 222-224): Added `flex: 1; min-width: 0; overflow: hidden;` to allow it to grow but constrain within available space
3. **Screen title** (lines 229-231): Added `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;` to gracefully truncate with ellipsis if the title is too long
4. **Currency bar** (line 244): Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent it from shrinking

This solution ensures:
- The back button and currency bar maintain their size (never shrink)
- The title block takes up the remainin...

- Split item content into three spans: `item-label`, `item-separator`, and `item-desc` for better styling control

<summary>Agent "Fix miniboss music trigger" completed</summary>
<result>Excellent! All 103 tests pass. Let me create a comprehensive summary of the implementation.

## Summary

I've successfully fixed the hard mode miniboss music trigger in the Dorf battle system following TDD practices. Here's what was implemented:

### Problem
When hard mode adds extra enemies to formerly-solo miniboss waves (e.g., `dire_wolf` in `forest_02` now has `goblin_chieftain` + `goblin_warrior` alongside it), the miniboss music didn't play because the system only checked `enemies.length === 1`.

### Solution
Added an `isMinibossWave` flag to battle data that explicitly marks miniboss encounters, allowing miniboss music to trigger regardless of enemy count.

### Files Modified

#### 1. **Core Music System**
- **`/home/deltran/code/dorf/src/data/audio/bgmContextMap.js`**
  - Updated `getBattleTrack()` to accept `isMinibossWave` parameter...

Is there a "companion font" that would be good to use for 'all the normal text' in the game that would vibe with the banner (and now title) font but be pratidcally just as easy to read as what we're using now? (must be free, must allow us to use it in commercial products)

**11:05** — Hmmm... What kind of fonts do games like AFK Arena and Genshin Impact use for their 'block of text' fonts?

## Summary: The Funniest Hero Name in Dorf

After reviewing all 100+ heroes in the codebase, **"Ticket Scalper Tom"** is hands-down the funniest hero name. Here's why:

### The Winner: Ticket Scalper Tom

**File**: `/home/deltran/code/dorf/src/data/heroes/3star/ticket_scalper_tom.js:1-104`

The humor comes from the perfect storm of:
- **The name**: Mundane and immediately relatable—he's literally just a guy scalping tickets
- **His epithet**: "The Lucky Bastard" — crude, self-aware, perfect
- **His intro quote**: `"I'm not supposed to be here!"` — his entire character in one sentence
- **His lore**: A clerical error entered him in the tournament bracket. He won his first fight by **tripping his opponent into arena thorns**. He's been desperately surviving ever since, and the crowd loves him....

**11:10** — Some small display "problems".  1) I saw a cluster of heroes go and stand on the fireplace like they were on the mantle. The should be put elsewhere. 2) the hereos that go to the table -- maybe move the table to a higher X value? they are standing right on top of the main hero. 3) bar heroes have too low a Y value - they are standing on the bar. 4) Can you put the thought bubbles above the heroe's head? It covers them at the moment.

**11:13** — Yes it did! Thx!

**11:13** — 1

**11:14** — OK. So in a seperate session I got us Nunito Variable. Can we use Cinzel as much as possible everywhere, and use Nunito the rest of the time?

**11:15** — I messed up -- the bar heroes need a bigger X value, not Y. Letters are hard

**11:15** — thx!

**11:17** — [REDACTED:BW_SESSION_TOKEN]

**11:20** — New feature. Let's brainstorm how to show what the agents are doing. I sorta envision adding space to the right-hand side that looksl like a scroll and uses the assigned heroes portrait image and allow room for the actions the agent is taking to show next to it.

**19:05** — I would like to step through the recent dorf ui updates again. Can we start at the most substansial one, and step through and see if we did the work we said we did?

**19:24** — Actually, I have a set of docs that coinside with a bunch of dorf-critique commands. Can you try to find them?

**19:26** — I want to go in the order I originally went in, from the largest file to the smallest file. Can you tell me the suggestions from the first but biggest?

**19:40** — When I was in a Genus Loci fight I got to via the region map, and I beat the GL and left the victory screen, it redirected me to the to the Map room instead of back to the region map.

**19:43** — You oritinally re-organized these by easy css-only fixes, simple fixes, medium-weight fixes, and heavy lifts. Can you try to do that now?

**19:44** — ok, I don't think I actually did much of this one.. I know I didn't do any heavy lifts, but I'm not sure I did any of the other stuff either.

Currently, that means we will need an Admin, Tooltips, and Context permission. Can we re-factor the app to use these permissions instead of what we have, give Patrick and Don full permissions, update the existing apps to use the new middleware check, and re-document how authorization works so when we make a new app in backoffice you'll automatically know what and how to add authorization to it.

**20:59** — can we look at the next biggest file pls?

**21:00** — Can we look at the code and see what, if any, of the easy/simple/medium items got implemented?

**21:02** — Yes, please implement all of these. code-level changes need tests.

**21:07** — so, lemme share a picture of how the detail ledger looks on this computer: "C:\Users\deltr\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2026-02-16 210641.png"

**21:12** — hey, previously we talked about using different models for developing when we have a good spec. do you remember that?

**21:13** — Just making sure we rememberd. I used my other account a lot today, but I'm at 75% usage for the week all ready :laugh: so I was making sure we were using sonnet for more coding tasks.

**21:14** — nothing in this thread. have another session working on ui stuff. actually, can we look at the 3rd largest ui suggestion file here?

**21:16** — can we see how much, if any of it, is implemented?

**21:20** — can you please organize these by easy css fixes, small fixed, medium-weight updates, and heavy lifts? 

**21:22** — weekend banner tip? it should only show once ever. what's it doing now?

**21:23** — just do the easy and simple (that are left). the heavy one is written elsewhere, and I'm not in favor of the medium

**21:24** — can we do  this work in a worktree please? also, all code level adjustments need tests

**21:27** — can we look at the 4th biggest ui file?

**21:28** — see what's done and organize them, pls

**21:34** — so, it wasn't that an orange block was rendered -- it is allowing what's under it to come through. lemme give you a larger screenshot so ou can see that.: "C:\Users\deltr\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2026-02-16 213404.png"

**21:38** — 4: bring it to 32px not 40. 5: this is done. 1: think this is done too. Otherwise, do simple, easy, and medium. work in a worktree and do tdd for things that have real code changes.

**21:39** — "C:\Users\deltr\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2026-02-16 213926.png" --- refreshed by right-clicking and saying refrehs. still see-thru

<summary>Agent "Add banner swipe feedback" completed</summary>
<result>Perfect! Everything looks good. Let me create a quick summary document of what was implemented.

## Summary

I've successfully implemented visual feedback for banner swipe gestures in `GachaScreen.vue`. Here's what was done:

### Implementation Details

**1. Added State Management** (`/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/.worktrees/gacha-polish/src/screens/GachaScreen.vue`)
- Added `bannerTranslateX` ref to track the current drag offset (line 39)

**2. Enhanced Touch Handlers**
- `handleBannerTouchStart`: Initializes drag by storing start position and resetting translation (lines 577-580)
- `handleBannerTouchMove`: **NEW** - Calculates drag distance and applies capped translation (±30px max) for visual feedback (lines 582-586)
- `handleBannerTouchEnd`: Resets translation with smooth transition, then triggers banner navigation if threshold (50px) ex...

**22:20** — #9, please make it just say bulk merge. otherwise, do easy, simple, medium. do work in a worktree, code changes need tests.

**22:22** — Can we just copy the dorf assets we use into this project? Not thinking that I'm going to update it - and if I do we can just do that. I want this to be a stand-alone repo.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the ember particle reduction feature for the gacha screen. Here's what was done:

### Implementation Changes

**File: `/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/.worktrees/gacha-polish/src/screens/GachaScreen.vue`**

1. **Added state tracking** (line 67):
   - Added `hasPerformedRitual` ref to track whether any ritual has been performed

2. **Updated ritual completion** (line 431):
   - Modified `runRitualAnimation()` to set `hasPerformedRitual = true` after the ritual completes

3. **Updated EmberParticles component** (lines 747-751):
   - Changed from static values to conditional values based on `hasPerformedRitual`
   - **Before any ritual**: `count={16}`, `intensity="medium"`
   - ...

## Summary

I've successfully completed both CSS fixes in `/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/.worktrees/gacha-polish/src/screens/GachaScreen.vue`:

### 1. Black Market Transition Speed (Changed from 0.4s to 0.3s)

**Changes made:**
- **Line 530**: Changed `setTimeout` from 400ms to 300ms in `enterBlackMarket()` function
- **Line 539**: Changed `setTimeout` from 400ms to 300ms in `exitBlackMarket()` function  
- **Line 1395**: Changed CSS animation from `slideInFromRight 0.4s` to `slideInFromRight 0.3s`

This makes the Black Market view transition snappier and more responsive.

### 2. Continue Button Overlap Protection

**Changes made:**
- **Line 1615**: Added `margin-bottom: 100px;` to `.summary-grid` CSS rule for clearance
- **Line 1626**: Added `margin-bott...

<result>Perfect! All 5 fixes are implemented and tested. Let me create a summary document:

## Implementation Summary

All 5 fixes have been successfully implemented in PartyScreen.vue with TDD approach:

### ✅ Fix 1: Party rename input left-align
- **Changed:** CSS `.rename-input` from `text-align: center` to `text-align: left` (line 611)
- **Test:** Verifies rename input element exists and is rendered

### ✅ Fix 2: Rename "Manage Heroes" → "Browse Heroes"
- **Changed:** Button label text from "Manage Heroes" to "Browse Heroes" (line 403)
- **Test:** Verifies button displays "Browse Heroes" text

### ✅ Fix 3: Auto-Fill confirmation prompt
- **Added:** `handleAutoFill()` function that shows `window.confirm()` before executing (lines 248-268)
- **Changed:** Button click handler from `@click="heroesStore.autoFillParty"` to `@click="handleAutoFi...

**22:26** — Three things. 1) I want to try to make this a one-step install. I'm aware it's basicaly a bash script that runs and does everything and ask for the user to do the things they need to do. That's fine. I'd like to try to have that. I see other things have that and I'm jealous. 2) I want to add a small [x] somewhere to the interface so that you can close it from there. 3) I want to be able to run this from any directory with a command and it be backgrounded.  /implementing-design-docs

<result>Excellent! All 18 tests are passing. Now let's create a comprehensive summary document:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented all 8 critique fixes across the MergeScreen, ShardsScreen, AttunementScreen, and MergePlannerModal components, following TDD practices. All changes were made in the worktree at `/home/deltran/code/github/dorf/.worktrees/party-merge-polish`.

### Implementation Summary

#### ✅ Fix 1: Shard Hunting Slot Sizing (ShardsScreen)
- **File:** `src/screens/ShardsScreen.vue`
- Increased portrait size from 40px to 56px (`.slot-portrait` CSS)
- Increased hero name font size from 0.6rem to 0.75rem (`.slot-name` CSS)
- Added 2-line name wrap support with `line-height: 1.2`, `max-height: 2.4em`, and `white-space: normal`
