# Goals

## Active Projects

### dorf (Vue.js game)
- Fusion essence system on `feat/fusion-essence-system` branch
- Entity framework and game mechanics development
- Browser-based, Vue.js stack

### bullpen-web (React dashboard)
- Dashboard development and feature work

### Claude Code Memory System
- Tier 1 complete: observations/tensions capture, load-history.sh, session state persistence
- Tier 2 in progress: self-space, methodology notes, /rethink cycle
- Future: continued friction-driven adoption of patterns as needs emerge

## Persistent Threads

- **Context window discipline** -- continuously refine the delegation model based on what actually preserves quality
- **Operational learning** -- let friction accumulate, process in batches, harden into rules or tooling
- **Session continuity** -- reduce the cold-start cost of new sessions; raw logs + state files + peer awareness
